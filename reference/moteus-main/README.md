# moteus brushless servo #

This contains full designs for the moteus brushless servo actuator,
including firmware and PCBs.

**WARNING**: This is not just a software project.  It includes designs
for moderately high power electronics.  It has not yet burned down my
(or anyone's that I know of) house, but there are no guarantees.
